// POINTER ARITHMETIC:
// Any arithmetic that involves an address is called as pointer arithmetic
// The only possible pointer arithmetic are:
// address + number 	is an address
// address - number 	is an address
// address - address	is a number (This happens with the addresses of any 2 elements of an array to know the number of elements in between these 2 addresses)//j


// points to rember : 

 // ***name of the array refers to the first element of the array (arr =&arr[0])
