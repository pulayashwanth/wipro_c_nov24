// type def is notthing but aliyas in structure


// struct books{

// char name[30];

// };

// for above structure if we need to create an object we should do 

//  struct books b1

// to get away of using that struct on every single object creation 

// so we use type def look at the below example 

// #typedef struct books{

// char name[30];

// }book;

// here book which is written at the last is call called alias we can wite from now 

// book b1;

// you can use (book b2 ;) to create the  object
