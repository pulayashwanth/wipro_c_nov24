// Type casting (Conversion of data from one DT to another)

// Upcast: Conversion of a lower DT (int) to higher DT (float / double)

// Down cast: Conversion of a higher sized DT to lower sized DT (int to short int or float to int or double to float)

// Implicit Cast: The cast which happens implicitly(automatically)

// Explicit cast: Where the cast is visible with code

// Down cast is more dangerours before there is chance of loss/change of data

// Up cast is not so dangerous yet not good: There is no change or loss of data but more memory will be used.

// Casting must be avoided. It is usually design errors.
